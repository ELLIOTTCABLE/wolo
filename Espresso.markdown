Espresso
========
[Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/ "MacRabbit's Espresso Text Editor")
is the Next Big Thing™ for Mac OS X development. I'm a “Sugar Daddy” — i.e.
one who develops Sugars, which is what MacRabbit calls the extension bundles
made available to Espresso for languages and frameworks.
