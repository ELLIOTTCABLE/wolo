EVE-Online
==========

Just some stuff for [EVE-Online](http://eve-online.com/ "the EVE-Online homepage"),
the greatest MMORPG ever made.

Missions to avoid
-----------------
- Level 3
  - New Frontiers *(the fifth mission [just sucks](http://blog.elliottcable.name/posts/guide_to_eve_online_s_new_frontiers_5_of_7_an_unexpected_twist_.xhtml))*
  - A Million Little Pieces *(locks out battleships, and the target takes forever to destroy with cruiser weaponry)*

Skills
======

Learning Path
-------------
This is the absolutely-most-efficient-possible path to learn all of the
necessary learning skills in the least time possible.

We start by leap-frogging the basic Learning skill with the Intelligence and
Memory skills (because those skills make training all other learning skills
train faster).
    
    Learning 1
    Analytical Mind 1
    Instant Recall 1
    Learning 2
    Analytical Mind 2
    Instant Recall 2
    Learning 3
    Analytical Mind 3
    Instant Recall 3
    Learning 4
    Analytical Mind 4
    Instant Recall 4
    
At this point, we can train advanced skills, and they will take much less time
to train than level 5 in the basic skills.
    
    Logic 1
    Eidetic Memory 1
    Logic 2
    Eidetic Memory 2
    Logic 3
    Eidetic Memory 3
    
Now we've reached the threshold where level 4 of the advanced skills will take
more time than level 5 of the basic skills, so we go back and finish them off.
    
    Learning 5
    Analytical Mind 5
    Instant Recall 5
    Logic 4
    Eidetic Memory 4
    
After this, the order of the skills doesn't matter as much - just follow the
`1234.123.5.4` pattern laid out above.

Transport
---------
This list shows the maximum storage capacity of each transport ship in the
game. Industrials and Transport Ships are shown first, followed by Freighters
and Jump Freighters. The first number is without rigs, the second is fully
rigged (which is more than slightly unrealistic, seeing as that would make the
ship astronomically expensive). I emphasized the largest values for each
class.

- Sigil: 12,635 (20,924)
	- Prorator: 8,258 (11,892)
- Bestower: 15,856 (26,257)
	- Impel: 27,387 (39,437)
- Providence: 918,750
	- Ark: 344,531

- Badger: 8,382 (13,881)
	- Crane: 7,112 (10,241)
	- Bustard: 23,165 (33,357)
- Badger Mark II: 13,602 (22,525)
- Charon: 981,250
	- Rhea: 367,969

- Iteron: 6,096 (10,095)
	- Viator: 7,773 (11,192)
	- Occator: 26,850 (38,664)
- Iteron Mark II: 7,620 (12,619)
- Iteron Mark III: 12,630 (20,916)
- Iteron Mark IV: 13,602 (22,525)
- Iteron Mark V: 25,270 (41,848)
- Obelisk: 937,500
	- Anshar: 351,563

- Wreathe: 6,706 (11,105)
	- Prowler: 6,604 (9,510)
- Hoarder: 13,213 (21,881)
- Mammoth: 18,581 (30,770)
	- Mastodon: 22,112 (31,841)
- Fenrir: 900,000
	- Nomad: 337,500

To summarize, the Iteron Mark V wins both for maximum unrigged Industrial
storage, and overall for rigged storage. However, the Impel wins for unrigged
Transport storage (which seems the most cost-effective to me). As for
Freighters, the Caldari win for both classes. Overall, I'd suggest training
Amarr industrials, because they'll provide the quickest return — not to
mention that they're rather sturdy.
