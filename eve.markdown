EVE-Online
==========

Just some stuff for [EVE-Online](http://eve-online.com/ "the EVE-Online homepage"),
the greatest MMORPG ever made.

Missions to avoid
-----------------
- Level 3
  - New Frontiers *(the fifth mission [just sucks](http://blog.elliottcable.name/posts/guide_to_eve_online_s_new_frontiers_5_of_7_an_unexpected_twist_.xhtml))*
  - A Million Little Pieces *(locks out battleships, and the target takes forever to destroy with cruiser weaponry)*

Skills

Learning Path
-------------
This is the absolutely-most-efficient-possible path to learn all of the
necessary learning skills in the least time possible.

We start by leap-frogging the basic Learning skill with the Intelligence and
Memory skills (because those skills make training all other learning skills
train faster).
    
    Learning 1
    Analytical Mind 1
    Instant Recall 1
    Learning 2
    Analytical Mind 2
    Instant Recall 2
    Learning 3
    Analytical Mind 3
    Instant Recall 3
    Learning 4
    Analytical Mind 4
    Instant Recall 4
    
At this point, we can train advanced skills, and they will take much less time
to train than level 5 in the basic skills.
    
    Logic 1
    Eidetic Memory 1
    Logic 2
    Eidetic Memory 2
    Logic 3
    Eidetic Memory 3
    
Now we've reached the threshold where level 4 of the advanced skills will take
more time than level 5 of the basic skills, so we go back and finish them off.
    
    Learning 5
    Analytical Mind 5
    Instant Recall 5
    Logic 4
    Eidetic Memory 4
    
After this, the order of the skills doesn't matter as much - just follow the
`1234.123.5.4` pattern laid out above.
